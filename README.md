Self-Healing Cloud Infrastructure

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a self-healing cloud infrastructure that can automatically detect failures and recover without manual intervention. The system continuously monitors cloud resources and services, identifies abnormal behavior, and triggers predefined healing actions to restore normal operation. The goal is to improve system availability, reliability, and operational efficiency in cloud environments.

🎯 Objectives
	•	To study self-healing mechanisms in cloud computing
	•	To design a cloud system capable of automatic failure detection
	•	To implement automated recovery actions
	•	To reduce system downtime and manual intervention
	•	To evaluate system performance through testing

⸻

🛠️ System Description

The self-healing cloud system consists of:
	•	A cloud environment using virtual machines or containers
	•	Monitoring components to track system health
	•	Failure detection logic based on monitored metrics
	•	Automated recovery actions such as service restart or resource reallocation

⸻

⚙️ Methodology

The project begins with a study of existing self-healing cloud systems and identification of system requirements. A cloud architecture with monitoring and automated recovery is designed and implemented using virtual machines or containers. Failures are simulated to test the system, and performance is evaluated based on recovery time and reliability.

⸻

🧪 Testing

Failures are intentionally introduced into the cloud environment to observe system behavior. The effectiveness of the self-healing mechanism is evaluated by measuring downtime, recovery time, and system stability after healing actions.

⸻

🚀 Expected Outcomes
	•	Improved system availability
	•	Reduced downtime during failures
	•	Automated recovery without manual intervention
	•	Better understanding of self-healing cloud architectures
